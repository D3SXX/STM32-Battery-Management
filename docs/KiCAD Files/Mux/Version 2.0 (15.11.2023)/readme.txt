Mux board version 2.0 by Vlad R.
Modified version of Mux board
Changes are -
Names for pins and connections were taken straight from the datasheet for consistency
The Schematic was simplified by using more different output socket pins
Pcb was remade from scratch to reduce the number of jumpwires (now it is 0) and to make it more easier to set up.
Also pcb design now uses only 0.8mm traces

Changes from the already made PCB -
Name is now mirrored correctly

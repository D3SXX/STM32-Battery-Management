Report 19.09.2023 

Host - Vladislav 

Participants - Siyuan, Samuel, Sergiu

Group Progress: 

Siyuan: Studied LL, Clock 

Samuel: researched his issue on github (temperature cell) 

Sergiu: Studied LL and wrote code for lm35 using LL, Grafana implementation 

Vladislav: Studied LL and helped writing code for lm35 using LL, Multiplexer, MOSFET research 

TODO: 

Siyuan: Implement correct clock configuration 

Samuel: Use AIV 

Sergiu: What we host the project on, make a database for, put some issues in backlog and organize them better on github. 

Vladislav: MOSFET, Multiplexer for reading temperature 

Everyone: Start making steps for making a PCB 

Problems facing: 

Siyuan: LL and STM32 Clock – either implement re-flow of internal clock and work with external clock 

Vladislav: MOSFET design 

Question: 

Siyuan: What grafana run on (C/python, etc.) -> Sergiu response – the language doesn’t matter 

How do you send data from microcontroller to grafana 

There is a script that will do everything for receiving and feeding grafana (using serial)

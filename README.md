# STM32-Battery-Management 

## TODO :

- Temperature Reading
- Voltage / Battery
- PSU
- IoTTicket
- Modbus
- Figure out the MOSFETs
  - > _Should_ be easy to implement since we have done something very similar in the past

    
## To keep in mind for the future : 

- KiCAD Design
- Getting a quote from JLCPCB/PCBWAY etc.
- Powercells
- > Would be nice to test if real cells work, dummy cells will get tested before obv

# STM32-Battery-Management 

## TODO :

- Temperature Reading
- Voltage / Battery
- PSU
- IoTTicket
- Modbus
 > _Should_ be easy to implement since we have done something very similar in the past
- Figure out the MOSFETs
    
## To keep in mind for the future : 

- KiCAD Design
- Getting a quote from JLCPCB/PCBWAY etc.
- Powercells
 > Would be nice to test if real cells work, dummy cells will get tested before obv
